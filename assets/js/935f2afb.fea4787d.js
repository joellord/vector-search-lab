Atlas Search is built on Apache Lucene. Lucene utilizes a combination of the Vector Space Model (VSM) and the Boolean model to determine the relevance score of each search result. The VSM assesses the similarity between the query and the document, while the Boolean model determines if the document contains all the query terms. Based on these factors, Lucene assigns a score to each search result, indicating its relevance to the query.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"atlas-search/search-index":{"id":"atlas-search/search-index","title":"Create Atlas Search indexes","description":"MongoDB\'s Atlas Search is a full-text search solution built on top of Apache Lucene.
